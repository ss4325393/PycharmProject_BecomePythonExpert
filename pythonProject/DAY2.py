User interaction :
Console Application : On single color window ,we interact through keyboard. Data only in text format 
GUI Application : Graphical User Interface: We interact through keyboard ,mouse or other peripherals.

In Console :
we have two ready made function to interact with the user:print and input 
print :To print or display the data on screen 
input:To collect or input the data from screen or from user 

print Basic Version :Syntax 
print(value/variable/expressions/conditions/functions..)

In python how to swap two variables:
python supports assining values to multiple variable in single statement

# Variables in Python

- Think of variables as a box that we can store things in, such as numbers, strings, characters, and a whole lot more.

- Variables can be created to store a particular value that we can add to overtime, but we can also completely replace it with something else if need be. 

- Variables are also useful because they can act as a name for the information that it is storing, and we can get access to that data whenever we use its name.

## Assignment statements

- An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value.

#### Syntax:

```
variable_name = value
```

# Variable Naming Rules in Python

1. Variable name should start with letter(a-zA-Z) or underscore (_).

- Valid : age , _age , Age
- Invalid : 1age

2. In variable name, no special characters allowed other than underscore (_).

- Valid : age_ , _age
- Invalid : age_*

3. Variables are case sensitive.

- age and Age are different, since variable names are case sensitive.

4. Variable name can have numbers but not at the beginning.

- Example: Age1

5. Variable name should not be a Python keyword.Keywords are also called as reserved words.

- Example: pass, break, continue.. etc

"""
# Good Variable Names

```

### Bad Variable Names
```

Greeting = "Hello there!"   # also looks weird
x = "Hello again!"          # what the heck is x?

***Getting user input using the _input()_ built-in function. Let us assign the data we get from a user into first_name and age variables.***

**Example:**
# Data Types

- Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary etc.

## Checking Data types and Casting

- Check Data types: To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the _type_

**Example:**
"""
# import math
# print(math.pi)
# p1 = 3.141592653589793
# p1

# ## Python
# # 5 variables : 5
# a = 23
# b = 23
# c = 23
# d = 23
# e = 23
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(id(c))
# print(id(d))
