print extended version 1:
print 5 Star in single line using 5 print statement with printing 
one star every time using one print.

we can pass few optional parameters in print : there are two default variable which can be passed in print ie end and sep
end and separator 
Default value of end is '\n'
Default value of sep is ' '
when we run print statement, end variable is printed at the end of the statement, sep variable is printed within argument (Within every argument)

we have multiple escape character in python : which are escaped from the screen means they are not printed on the screen but they will leave a spacial functionality on the screen 
\t: Tab
\n: new line character

values: values are the values directly printed, taken by user as input or saved in variable, values are associated with some data types having there own rules like string is printed through quotes,list is printed through square brackets, int is printed directly  
Identifiers :User defined names like names of variables,names of functions and names of classes.
keywords: Predefined Names 

There are few set of rules for identifiers:
valid Identifiers:
1.English Alphabets are allowed ie small letters or capital letters  
2.Numbers are allowed but names should not start with numbers
3.only one special character ie _ Underscore is allowed. Other spacial character is not allowed. space is also a spacial character so its not allowed 
4. python is case sensitive language or identifiers are case sensitive
invalid Identifiers:

coding principles: How to write neat and clear code 
1.logical names given to identifiers
